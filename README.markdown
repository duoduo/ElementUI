## About

ElementUI is a collection of web UI elements from 365psd.com (and most likely from other sources in the future). 

### Why

I really like the UI elements from 365psd.com and it is a shame some of these designs are never turned into real HTML/CSS counterparts. If done well, many of these designs can turned into real UI elements that can be used by many. 

### License

You are free to use anything in this for personal or commercial use. This is the same license as found on http://365psd.com/about/. I will always provide attribution to the original designer and the developer who transformed it into its HTML/CSS counterpart. Please do the same, it will allow all parties to benefit from the information and work (million dollars for eveveryone!).

### Work in progresss

This is a very young idea. Please keep in mind this is a work in progress. I will attempt to come up with sane conventions and standards to make it easy to contribute. Hang on.

### Manifesto

To provide high quality forms of UI elements. All UI elements will use the latest standards where possible and will lean towards using the latest html5, css3, and js standards.
